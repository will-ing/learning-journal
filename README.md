## Growth Mindset

**Growth mindset** is like working in space that requires you to utilize the tools around you to create the best outcome. Below are some examples of growht mindset.

* Being stranded on an Island and having to survive.
* Collaborating to figure out a solution to a problem.

## Remind yourself
1. Without resistance you can't grow
1. When it doubt reach out
1. There are no failures only lesson
