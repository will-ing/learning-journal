## Intro

Hi my name is Will. I am an army veteran that is looking to develop skills to effectively change careers in to a software development field. I currently work in the retail outdoor industry for a company called "*evo*". I have lived in Washington for 8 years. The mountains and the greenery is what I like most about it here. Below is what I think when thinking about grownth mindset.

## Growth Mindset

**Growth mindset** is like working in space that requires you to utilize the tools around you to create the best outcome. Below are some examples of growht mindset.

* Being stranded on an Island and having to survive.
* Collaborating to figure out a solution to a problem.

## Remind yourself
1. Without resistance you can't grow
1. When it doubt reach out
1. There are no failures only lesson
