## Things about storing strings, quotes, booleans and variables

 *  Use "" or '' to store a string.
 *  You can escape using a \ before any type of quote marks
 * Boolean values can only be true or false.
 * You can us shorthand to create variables is 3 different ways.
    * Variable are declared and values assigned in the same statement
        * var price = 5;
        * var quantity = 14;
        * var total = price * quantity;
    * 3 variables are declared on the same line, then values assigned to each
        * var price, quantity, total;
        * price = 5;
        * quantity = 14;
        * total = price * quantity;
    * 2 variable are declared and assigned values on the same line. Then one is declared and assigned a value on the next line.
        * var price = 5, quantity = 14;
        * var total =  price * quantity;
* You can change the value of a variable. later on in you code.    "*pg 68*"

1. Name must begin with a letter, dollar sign or an underscore.
2. The name must contain letters, numbers, dollar sign or underscore.
3. Do not use keywords (var) or reserved words (future versions).
4. all varibles are case sensitive. 
5. Use a name that describes the kind of infomation that the variable stores
6. If var is more than one word than captilized the first letter in the second word.
