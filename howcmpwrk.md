# How computers work

## What makes a computer?

process| types of
---- | ---- 
Input| Keyboard, verbal, touchscreen
Storage| stores information
processing| uses algorithms (series of commands)
Output| display, text, videos, control a robot, input to another computer.

## How it works

* Wires and circuits carry all the information
* signals can be on or off, yes or no, true or false, (callled a bit)
* The binary number system
    * only 2 digits
    * each position is multiplied by 2 (2,4,,16)
    * any number can be represented by 1s and 0s
* Text in binary
    * letters can have on of offs that will represent them
* Pixels are represented with numbers too
* Vibrations are converted to numbers and can give you sound. the more bits you have the higher quality the sound.

## circuits and logic

* Circuits - modify and process information.
    * not - flips the input
    * adder - adds two bits together to get a sum. You can chain them together
    * The closer the circuits that faster they go.


## Parts of a computer
* Memory
    * stores the binary code.
    * houses the operating system.
* Input devices
* Central processing unit - master chip that controls all parts of the computer. (math, logic, send, receive)
    * 
* Output devices
* software - tells the cpu what to do. Series of commands made up of binary code.
