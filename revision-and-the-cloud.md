# Revision and the cloud

**What is Git?** - Git is used for collaboration and store files in snapshots. Keeps snapshots of your coe at points in time.

* It keeps track of the history of your files.
* It records states of your files. With git e can view apply and remove the changes.
* Keeps all of your projuct files in one repository.

Without version control you have to rename the file and save it.

**Commits** - are a the changes made to each file. Equivalent of "save as". Each commit has a "HEAD". A head is equal to the meaning that you are hear. You can also give commits messages. The messages are like writing captions to your snapshot.


*The efficiency of Git is that it can take snapshot. This uses less data. You can make changes in your first draft and it will effect your other layers.*

**Github** - is a centralized way for all developers to share code. Its online so your code is backed up.
* You can have lots of team members work togethre on the same files, without messing each other up.
* Keep a history of each file over tme.
* Work on code on your computer and sync it online

**Repositories** - A place of storage for your files that you told Git to pay attention to.
* Usually one project = one repository
* Really large projects mitht have multiple repos for different parts of their system
* Can live on Github or your computer.
